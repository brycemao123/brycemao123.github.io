<h2 id="the-ics-314-software-engineering-experience">The ICS-314: Software Engineering Experience</h2>
<p>During the course of this semester, I learned many things about web developement and software engineering in this class. From Open Source Software Development, Configuration Management, Functional Programming, and Design Patterns to Coding Standards, User Interface Frameworks, and Ethics in Software Engineering. 
But I believe that the most important topics among these software engineering concepts are Coding Standards, Design Patterns, and Agile Project Management.</p>

<h2 id="coding-standards--communication-is-key-like-a-paragraph-with-jumbled-sentences">Coding Standards ( communication is key? like a paragraph with jumbled sentences?)</h2>
<p>Imagine trying to read a book that didn’t have proper grammar. You might still be able to understand what the writer is saying, after some deciphering, but it would still be tedious and annoying. 
This analogy can be made to code without any coding standards. While you could tell how certain functions work, you would still wouldn’t get the whole picture unless you finished understanding how each part works in tandem with each other. 
As someone who wants to persue a career in programming, I believe that coding standards are an important to an individual, as well as a group, because readability is essential for understanding what does what. 
For example, if you need help and your code is unreadable, it will be much harder for someone to help you as they would first need to decipher your code rather than focus on the actual problem.</p>
