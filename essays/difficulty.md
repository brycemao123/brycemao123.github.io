## The Importance of Design Patterns
  I believe that design patterns are important to software engineering because they perfectly encapsulate the phrase "don't reinvent the wheel." Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems, such as using an existing template, workflow, or previous work to solve a software engineering issue. This is means that not everything needs to be made from scratch so one's time can be better spent actually implementing unique features. Because design patterns are often stardardized, there's usually documentation that helps people almost universally understand how to utilize that design pattern. This can make design patterns very powerful as, not only do you have a good foundation of tested code, but if you have a problem, it can be easily understood and answered by others. 

## Utilizing Design Patterns
ICS-314: Software Engineering has shown me how to best utilize design patterns in order to make me a better programmer. For example, I've utilized design patterns in order to create my groups final project for the semseter: Quizzacious, a web application that allows students to create and share quizzes with each other in order to help them study. For this project, we used an existing template, called bowfolios, and converted it to our needs using the skills we learned from previous homeworks and WODS(programming workouts of the day).
